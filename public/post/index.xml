      <description>In this class, I am learning how to use R to program and create functions. During the first week of the course, we learned basic R syntax in order to prepare us to use this language for its most common function: data modeling. Week 2 consisted of learning R data types, structures, and frames. This ended up leading us to our first homework assignment, where we had emulate a French roulette, write an R function that calculates the number of mortgage payment terms given 3 inputs, and display data from Iris and Coronavirus files.</description>
