 :wave:

I am a sophomore double majoring in Statisitcs and Psychology at the University of Illinois. I speak Spanish fluently and I'm on the Women's Rowing team. :rowboat:

The statistics courses I am taking this Spring 2020 semester are STAT 385 and STAT 400. The programming course I am currently taking is STAT 385, which is a course that provides the foundation for writing and packaging statistical algorithms through the creation of functions and object oriented programming.
